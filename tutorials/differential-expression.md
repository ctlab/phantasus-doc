## Introduction

This is the third of three related modules:
* [Preparing gene expression dataset]({% link tutorials/preparing.md%})
* [Exploring dataset]({% link tutorials/exploration.md%})
* [Differential expression and downstream analysis]({% link tutorials/differential-expression.md%})

In this module we start with a normalized and filtered dataset, do a differential
expression analysis and follow it up with pathway enrichment analysis.
