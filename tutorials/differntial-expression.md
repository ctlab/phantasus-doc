## Introduction

This is the third of three related modules:
* [Preparing gene expression dataset](preparing)
* [Exploring dataset](exploration)
* [Differential expression and downstream analysis](differential-expression)

In this module we start with a normalized and filtered dataset, do a differential
expression analysis and follow it up with pathway enrichment analysis.
