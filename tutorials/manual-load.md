## Introduction

In this tutorial we will consider how to manually load datasets into Phantasus.
While we try to make many of GEO datasets to work automatically in Phantasus
this is not always the case and sometimes some manual work is required.
Alternatively, you might obtain the data from core facility and want to analyze it,
or you have processed the raw data on your own and want to visualize it.

## Obtaining expression matrix from GEO supplementary files

For RNA-sequencing datasets there is no standard way to upload gene expression
matrices. 
Thanks to [ARCHS4 project](https://maayanlab.cloud/archs4/), 
some of RNA-sequencing datasets can be opened automatically in Phantasus,
but not all of them. For example, if you open
